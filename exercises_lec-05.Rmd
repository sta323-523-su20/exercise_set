# Exercise 1 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

## Problem

Use the built-in data frame `longley` to answer the following questions.

1. What year was the percentage of people employed relative to the population
   highest? Return the result as a data frame.
   
2. The Korean war took place from 1950 - 1953. Filter the data frame so it only
   contains data from those years.
   
3. What years did the number of people in the armed forces exceed the number
   of people unemployed? Give the result as an atomic vector.

## Solution

#### Part 1

```{r}
longley[which.max(longley$Employed / longley$Population), 
        "Year", drop=FALSE]
```

#### Part 2

```{r}
longley[longley$Year %in% 1950:1953, ]
```

#### Part 3

```{r}
longley$Year[longley$Armed.Forces > longley$Unemployed]
```

# Exercise 2 {.tabset .tabset-fade .tabset-pills}

## Problem

1. Use function `sloop::ftype()` to see which of the following functions are
   S3 generics: `mean`, `summary`, `print`, `sum`, `plot`, `View`, `length`, 
   `[`.

2. Choose 2 of the S3 generics you identified above. How many methods exist for
   each? Use function `sloop::s3_methods_generic()`.
   
3. How many methods exist for classes `factor` and `data.frame`. 
   Use function `sloop::s3_methods_class()`.
   
4. Consider a class called dollars. If a numeric vector has class dollars,
   function `print()` should print the vector with a $ in front of each number
   and round digits to two decimals.
   
## Solution

#### Part 1

```{r}
library(sloop)
```

Checking a couple of the functions:

```{r}
ftype(mean)
ftype(plot)
```

#### Part 2

```{r}
nrow(s3_methods_generic("mean"))
nrow(s3_methods_generic("plot"))
```

#### Part 3

```{r}
nrow(s3_methods_class("factor"))
nrow(s3_methods_class("data.frame"))
```

#### Part 4

```{r}
print.dollar <- function(x) {
  paste0("$", round(x, digits = 2))
}
```

```{r}
x <- 1:5
class(x) <- "dollar"
print(x)
```

```{r}
y <- c(4.292, 134.1133, 50.111)
class(y) <- "dollar"
print(y)
```
